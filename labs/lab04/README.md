# Lab 04: RSS & Atom Feeds

## Overview
This lab implements two XML feed formats for the personal website:
- RSS 2.0 feed (`rss.xml`)
- Atom 1.0 feed (`atom.xml`)

The feeds publish lab updates and link to actual completed lab landing pages.

- `rss.xml` - RSS 2.0 feed with channel metadata and lab items
- `atom.xml` - Atom 1.0 feed with feed metadata and lab entries
- `rss.css` - XML stylesheet used by both feeds for browser-readable presentation

- RSS feed: `/iit/labs/lab04/rss.xml`
- Atom feed: `/iit/labs/lab04/atom.xml`

- Homepage: `/iit/labs/lab03/lab03b/homepage.html`
- Lab 4 landing page: `/iit/labs/lab03/lab03b/lab04_landing.html`
- Labs landing page: `/iit/labs/lab03/lab03b/lab_landing.html`

Work completed in the `lab04` branch with staged commits for:
1. RSS feed creation
